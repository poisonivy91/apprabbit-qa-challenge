# AppRabbit QA Challenge (TypeScript + Playwright)

This repo contains two tests as requested:
1. **API test for the login flow** (TypeScript, using Playwright's API testing).
2. **UI test with Playwright** that mimics logging into the admin dashboard.

ðŸ‘‰ You can create a test account at [https://app.apprabbit.com/login](https://app.apprabbit.com/login) and set the credentials in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`).
